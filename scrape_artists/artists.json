Having many years of drawing and painting experience, settling in classical oils, and watercolour, I also made constant adjustments to evolving technologies and embraced them. In 1989, I was the only conventina and digital matte artist for film and television west of the Rockies. ...lol, at a time when 3D and digital photography were in gestation.   Design and execution experience for interior/exterior large format covers murals, backings for motion picture, trompe l'oeille, and space transition design. My interest in public mural art began long before it was desirable in the city. I began in 1970 with Ontario Place during it's construction, and since then have established considerable necessary technical understanding and equipment to achieve powerful performance at any location, providing access support is provided. My vocational focus has been in film and television, where I have created many different roles for myself from scenic artist to digital environment design, all of which are presently active in one form or another. Using my understanding of camera space geometry, and digital tools, my first step is to create a virtual master of the environment where the public work will be planned. this results in an exact representation of all design work in its proper context, and allows preview from all directions of approach to the work. Aside from massive brushes on long poles which I love, by the way, the principal gear I apply to the work comprises of a single rig of  5 touch-up guns, sharing a common manifold, applying a full primary pallette, identical to the ink jet printer colour mixing system, but designed back in 1970 for covering the work at Ontario Place. At that time my experience in film based optical procedures, colour separation, offset printing and preparing art for television, made this technical solution ideal for balancing performance with ease of access and speed. I have integrated old school understanding to cutting edge performance art. The design of this gear was revised in 1987 to what it remains today, ever-functional. It can be broken down to attach to a reciprocating boom lift for ultimate large format performance.  I can be reached for further information at filmartist@gmail.com .
